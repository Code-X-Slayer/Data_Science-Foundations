    "## 1. What is Data Science?\n",
    "- Data Science is about making sense of data.\n",
    "- It combines programming, statistics, and domain expertise.\n",
    "- Data can be structured (tables), semi-structured (JSON, XML), or unstructured (images, videos, text).\n",
    "- The goal is to convert raw data into useful insights and decisions."
