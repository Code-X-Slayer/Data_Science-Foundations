# About This Repository

This repository showcases my personal learning journey from the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera.

It contains study notes created entirely in my own words, inspired by the key topics and structure of the course.

Alongside the notes, it includes mini projects I developed myself to demonstrate practical skills.

All original course materials remain the property of IBM and Coursera. This repo shares only my interpretations and personal work. Full credit to IBM and the course instructors for their educational inspiration.

I will continue updating this repository to reflect ongoing learning progress.
