# About This Repository

This repository **showcases my personal learning journey** through the *IBM Data Science Professional Certificate* on Coursera.

## What You Will Find Here

- **Personal Study Notes:**  
  Created entirely in my *own words*, inspired by the key topics and overall structure of the course.

- **Mini Projects:**  
  Independently developed projects to apply and demonstrate the practical skills I gained.  
  For example, the **Weather Data Web App** project connects to the [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) and uses **Streamlit** to display **current weather and 1‚Äì2 day forecasts** interactively.  
  You can try the live app here: [üå§Ô∏è Weather App](https://codexslayer-weather-app.streamlit.app/)  
  This project applies Python programming, API handling, JSON data processing, and modular function design‚Äîall concepts explored in Courses 4 and 5 of the IBM specialization.

- All original educational content and materials remain the property of **IBM and Coursera**.  
- I credit IBM and the course instructors fully for providing the content and inspiration behind this learning path.  
- **Special Thanks:**  
  - To **WeatherAPI** for providing **free-tier access** to current weather data and 2-day forecasts‚Äîthis made it possible for students to experiment and learn.  
  - To **Streamlit** for making **building and deploying interactive apps simple and accessible**, which allowed me to create a working project with minimal setup.  
  - To **IBM** for providing high-quality foundational courses that made it possible to apply these skills practically.
